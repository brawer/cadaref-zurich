# Survey data

The files in this directory have been extracted from
[Amtliche Vermessungsdaten Stadt Zürich Jahresendstand 2007](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/geo_amtliche_vermessungsdaten_stadt_zuerich_jahresendstand_2007) using this [extraction script](../src/extract_survey_data.py).
The state of December 2007 is the earliest available digital dataset.

As of October 2024, the upstream data (despite its CC0-1.0 license)
cannot be accessed directly over the internet. Instead, users
have to manually request the data package via the city’s Open Data portal,
wait for an email, and only then they can retrieve the data from
a temporary URL that is sent in the e-mail. Because such a manual process
does not work with an automated software release, we opted to re-publish
the relevant excerpt of the data as part of our source code repository.


## License

The upstream data is released by the City of Zürich under the
terms of [Creative Commons CC0-1.0](LICENSE). The files in this directory
are released under the same terms. This work is published from Switzerland.
